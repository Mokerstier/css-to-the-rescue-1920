## Programm

### Week 1 
First week I started with a concept of food order while making a trip on a subway.
Allong the track all kind of things would happen.
  example: the background changes and while the order progresses the train will fill up with the users choices
  
This week i expirimented with svg and img masks to get certain interactions done.
Checkbox hack is working to start the interaction of the train moving
Hover was used to get the train doors open, and change the cursor to a spraycan

  
### Week 2
I changed the concept of the order to just the a train where the user can have some in teractions
the reason i changed is because my concept was getting to big and it was hard for me to get the total concept working.
And the css & html I wrote was getting real messy so it was hard to maintain the project.

This week i experimented allot with svgs

### Week 3 - ðŸŽª Show time
Working on implementing sounds with embed tag. Had some real troubles with getting this to work eventually got it fixed.
Problem was i didnt had the less installed on my desktop so my css file wouldn't build. Silly..
Guess thats the downside of working on 2 different setups.

Experimenting with print-style wich i really found a pain to work with.
Couldn't get my SVG image to show in the print style, but after Vitaly asked me if I tried another browser.
MAGIC opera works!!
